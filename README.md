# Anonbotv2
A better WL Anonbot, made with NodeJS

# Rules
Anonbot is moderated by a small team of dedicated students. They will remove any post that violates these rules, and they will IPban any user with repeated violations. The rules are very simple:

1. No racist/sexist/homophic etc. slurs. This is against Instagram's policy as well.
2. No spamming

If you use Anonbot safely and responsibly by following these two simple rules, you can create an enjoyable experience for everyone! Have fun!

# Disclaimers
For moderation purposes, every submission, as well as the IP address of the submitter, is logged for 10 days. We do not use your IPs for any purpose other than to IPban those who break the rules repeatedly. This should not affect you as long as you use Anonbot properly.

Anonbot is not endorsed by or affiliated with the West Lafayette High School in any way. This is simply a small and fun project created by West Side students who want to submit confessions and announce things anonymously.

If you believe a post should be taken down or have any questions/concerns about Anonbot, please email mattbstanciu@gmail.com
