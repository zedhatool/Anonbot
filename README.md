# Anonbotv2
A better WL Anonbot, made with NodeJS

# Rules
Anonbot is moderated by a small team of dedicated students. They will remove any post that violates these rules, and they will IPban any user with repeated violations. The rules are very simple:

1. Do not post anything that is against Instagram's policy (e.g. racial slurs)
2. Do not use Anonbot to spam the Instagram page

If you use Anonbot safely and responsibly by following these two simple rules, you can create an enjoyable experience for everyone! Have fun!

# FAQ
**Q: Why do you log IPs?**\
A: We want to make sure Anonbot isn't ruined by spammers and trolls, so we store IPs for a short period of time in order to keep track of recent posts. If we find repeated violations of the rules above from one IP address, that IP address will be banned from using the service.

**Q: I've heard of something like this before where the creators released personal info anyway. How can I be sure this is not the case with Anonbot?**\
A: Part of Anonbot's dedication to open-source code is to alleviate these kinds of worries. Anonbot does not store any personal information other than your IP address for a short amount of time. We cannot use your IP address to track you or find your personal information. The only thing we can see is that you live somewhere in West Lafayette (not even a specific location). Your name, Instagram account, etc. are simply not stored. **Even if we wanted to, Anonbot is made in a way that does not allow us to find who submitted a post.** If you would like to verify this claim, you can take a look at the *server.js* file in this repository, which contains the logic for Anonbot.

**Q: I've just seen a post on Anonbot that I believe is inappropriate. How can I get it removed?**\
A: If you see a post that you believe to be inappropriate, please do not report it to Instagram (this puts Anonbot as a whole at risk!). Instead, please DM **@anonbot.wl**, email **mattbstanciu@gmail.com**, or text **(765) 409-3260** to contact a moderator for deletion. Doing this will help moderate Anonbot and keep track of those who break the rules without risking the deletion of Anonbot as a whole by Instagram.

**Q: Is the school administration okay with this?**\
A: Anonbot was first created on June 20th, 2018, and v2 was first implemented on July 14th, 2018. Because Anonbot was created during the summer, the school administration does not know about it (see the dislcaimers section). We do not believe Anonbot is breaking any school rules, but if any conflicts arise in the future, we will comply fully.

# Disclaimers
For moderation purposes, every submission, as well as the IP address of the submitter, is logged for 10 days. We do not use your IPs for any purpose other than to IPban those who break the rules repeatedly. This should not affect you as long as you use Anonbot properly.

Anonbot is not endorsed by or affiliated with the West Lafayette High School in any way. This is simply a small and fun project created by West Side students who want to submit confessions and announce things anonymously.

If you believe a post should be taken down or have any questions/concerns about Anonbot, please email mattbstanciu@gmail.com
