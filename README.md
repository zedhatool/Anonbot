A better WL Anonbot, made with NodeJS

# Rules
Anonbot is moderated by a small team of dedicated students. They will remove any post that violates these rules, and they will IPban any user with repeated violations. The rules are very simple:

1. No racist/sexist/homophic etc. slurs. This is against Instagram's policy as well.
2. No spamming

If you use Anonbot safely and responsibly by following these two simple rules, you can create an enjoyable experience for everyone! Have fun!
